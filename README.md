# Main

TODO: paste in some stuff from our docs about the background and intentions behind this app

# Organization

The main features of our app (as of sprint 4) include
listing existing hives, adding new hives, and adding 
inspection logs to a hive. 

* Adding hives is the responsibility of `hive_form_fragment.xml` 
* Hive listing is contained in `hive_selection_list_item.xml` and `hive_selection_list_view.xml`
* 

Some files contain features not yet strictly supported, or accessible from the main view.
These include:

* `hive_diagram_fragment.xml` and `sample_hive_diagram_view.xml`, which will eventually support 
visualization of a yard
